## [Topic: Exploit] Log All the Things!

### Description
### One of our interns has created a new Java service called Super Safe Service which will allow us to review hacker applications 10x faster than now. I believe in him: he looks pretty motivated and hard-working. However, there is still a small voice in my head that tells me that I should review the code and check whether everything makes sense, and it is not vulnerable. What do you think? Do you think is a secure application? Perhaps... can you discover any SECRET variable?
